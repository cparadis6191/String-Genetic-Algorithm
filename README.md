String-Genetic-Algorithm
========================

A simple program to find the most varied binary string (i.e. 01010101)

### Usage

```bash
./genalg [number of generations]
```

### Example

Say you want to run through 250 generations. Simply run the following command:

```bash
./genalg 250
```

The program will end either when the generation limit is reached or when a perfect organism is found. Following is an example of the program's output.

The result in the example is a perfect organism.
